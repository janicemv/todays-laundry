# Today's Laundry

A simple JS to-do list using Bootstrap to keep track of the neverending pile of laundry that families normally need to deal with.

Of course, the list can be adapted to any to-do list. Laundry was just what I had in mind when I though of it. A fun exercise to learn Javascript and help with executive disfunction when there are simply too many things to do!

This is actually really helpful to keep open on your browser while working on the pc. Anytime something comes up to your mind, you write it on your to-do-list and take if off your head. Then, when you have a break or finish work-time, you can go back to it and see what is worth doing at that moment!

## Features

- Input to add new task
- Toggle checkbox
- Delete button
- Save to local storage - so your list is kept even if you refresh the page.

## Ideas for the future

- Add date/timestamp
- Add categories
- Move position of tasks
- Sync to other devices
